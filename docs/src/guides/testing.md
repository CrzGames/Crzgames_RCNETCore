# üß™ Unit Testing

Unit testing is a critical part of the development process in RCNET, ensuring that individual components function as expected. RCNET leverages the `doctest` framework to facilitate these tests. Here is how you can work with unit tests in your RCNET projects.

<br />

# üîç Overview

1. **Execution:** Unit tests are executed each time the executable is run, given that `-DENABLE_DOCTEST=ON` is specified.
2. **Test Inclusion:** Tests must be included within an include file or source file.
3. **Excluding Tests:** Exclude unit tests from the executable by specifying `-DENABLE_DOCTEST=OFF` flag to CMake during build configuration.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Writing a Unit Test

Unit tests are written in files : `*.cpp`, `*.h`, `*.hpp` using the `doctest` framework. Below is a basic example of how a test case might look:

```cpp
#include <doctest/doctest.h>

TEST_CASE("Example test case") {
    int x = 1;
    CHECK(x == 1); // This test will pass.
    CHECK(x == 2); // This test will fail.
}
```

::: tip NOTE
It is essential to structure your tests to cover as much of the codebase as possible to ensure comprehensive testing coverage.

By integrating unit tests into your development workflow, you can significantly improve the reliability and quality of your game, ensuring that each component performs as expected.
